### inspiration

A huge element of communication is nonverbal and conveyed through tone and body expression. We take this for granted, because our brains are able to automatically process it, but there are those who struggle to identify emotion and figurative language in daily life. Our goal is to use technology to bridge this gap in communication for those with social communication disorders, such as people with autism spectrum disorders. There are a lot of inventions designed to help people with physical disabilities, but less that help people with social communication disorders, and we want to change that.

### What it does

Emotion Radar uses complex algorithms to do what our brain automatically does - it takes images of the speaker, processes them using complex algorithms, and feedbacks the emotions the speaker is feeling to the user using easy-to-understand graphic figures we call EmotiBoos. This helps the user accurately interpret the emotions of the speaker and minimizes misunderstanding.
